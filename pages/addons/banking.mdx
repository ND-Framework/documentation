## createInvoice export
**parameters**
* amount: `number`
* due: `number`
* request: `boolean`
* from: `table`
    * name: `string`
    * account: `string`
    * source: `number`
    * character: `number`
* to: `table`
    * name: `string`
    * account: `string`
    * source: `number`
    * character: `number`
```lua copy
exports["ND_Banking"]:createInvoice(amount, due, request, from, to)
```

In this example the sender is a non player sender, and the receiver is a player. The invoice has 7 days to be paid. If the request parameter is set to `true{:lua}` then the player has to accept the invoice. In this example it's set to `false{:lua}` which makes the player required to pay it withing the due date.
```lua copy filename="example"
local from = {
    name = "Government",
    account = "0"
}

local player = NDCore.getPlayer(source)
local to = {
    character = player.id
}

local banking = exports["ND_Banking"]
banking:createInvoice(500, 7, false, from, to)
```
