#### dealerships.lua
In this file you create each dealership and locations.

* `showroomCategories`
If this is found and contains categories then vehicles from those categories will be randomly selected and added to the showroom.

* `categories`
This is the vehicle categories that can be purchased at that specific dealership, these will be found on the vehicle catalog when interacting with the dealership ped which is not the same menu as the showroom one when interacting with a vehicle.

* `blip`

* `groups`
ÃŒf this exists and is found then the dealership will use permissions to switch vehicle in the showroom, test drives, purchase vehicles, interact with target, & blip.

* `interact`
This is ped interaction, you can set the ped model, coords, and location of the vehicle if the player views a vehicle from the ped vehicle catalog menu.
