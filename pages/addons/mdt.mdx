## createDispatch export
If you're a developer and want to integrate this with your script you can use this:
```lua
exports["ND_MDT"]:createDispatch({
    caller = "John Doe",
    location = "Sandy shores", -- not required
    callDescription = "Whiteness bank robbery",
    coords = vec3(x, y, z) -- if this is used and location isn't used then it will still display the location from these coords.
})
```
