# ND_AppearanceShops
This resource creates working clothing shops, barber shops, and tattoo parlours. Players can also save their outfits at the clothing stores. This resource also has an export to open the wardrobe. This can be used in scripts to allow the player to save their clothing. An example would be a house script where players can access the wardrobe at their house.
