# Setup guide

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    We highly recommend using the txAdmin recipe over a manual installation.
</Callout>

## txAdmin recipe
<Steps>
### Download the latest stable artifact version.
Be sure to download version `12000` or higher. Don't use the "Latest Recommended" or "Latest Optional" buttons as they are very outdated.
* [Windows](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/)
* [Linux](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/)

### Setup Database
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Do **NOT** use XAMPP, you *will* run into issues.
</Callout>
- If you're on a VPS or dedicated server, Download & Install the latest version of [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/download/).
- If you're on a Zap Hosting game server, you can read their documentation on how to setup a database or reach out to their support team.
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    If you're on some other game server hosting, you should check out [Prism Host](https://prism-host.com) instead as using any host that isn't ZAP for game servers is against FiveM's Terms of Service & will result in your server or account being deleted.
</Callout>

### Start the server setup
Where ever you installed the artifacts to, open the directory and launch `fxserver.exe` & follow the steps prompted.

### Deploying the recipe
When prompted, select "Remote URL Template"

* `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ND-Framework/txadmin-recipe/main/recipe.yaml`

![](/static/txadmin-url.png)

Then continue.

### Setup Recipe Information
When prompted to input the parameters for the recipe, be sure you fill out the database information to match the respective information. If you can't see it, click "Show/Hide Database options (advanced)"

### Start the server
Once you have completed all of the steps, you can start the server. If you run into any issues, please see [Common Issues](#common-issues) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/andys-development-857672921912836116) server
