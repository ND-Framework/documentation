# Events
It's important you listen to non networked events correctly, read [listening for events](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/scripting-manual/working-with-events/listening-for-events/) and [RegisterNetEvent](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/scripting-reference/runtimes/lua/functions/RegisterNetEvent/).
