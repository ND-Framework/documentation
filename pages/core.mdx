## Importing NDCore
```lua copy filename="fxmanifest.lua"
shared_script "@ND_Core/init.lua"
```

You can also use this if you have multiple shared scripts.
```lua copy filename="fxmanifest.lua"
shared_scripts {
    "@ND_Core/init.lua"
}
```

If you're only using client or only using server you can also just import one of them.
```lua copy filename="fxmanifest.lua"
server_script "@ND_Core/init.lua"
```

```lua copy filename="fxmanifest.lua"
client_script "@ND_Core/init.lua"
```


---
Since every function in ND Core is an export you could also do it as shown in the example below:
```lua copy filename="client.lua"
local player = exports["ND_Core"]:getPlayer()

print(player.firstname)
```

You could also do it this way for simplicity:
```lua copy filename="client.lua"
local NDCore = exports["ND_Core"]

local player = NDCore:getPlayer()

print(player.firstname)
```
