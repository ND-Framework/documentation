## Why use the ND-Framework?
ND is growing very fast with new users everyday, if you're a server owner you can take advantage of the simplicity and how easy you can make new things for your server. If you're a developer we have a very good documentation that will show you how much ND will make your life easier. You can develop scripts way quicker than if you wouldn't use ND.

## What makes ND-Framework different?
When ND v1 was released it was criticized by many developers and we received a lot of feedback which improved ND very quickly. ND was completely rewritten for v2 and focused heavily on security and optimization. It has been heavily tested and is constantly improving. You can check it out for yourself it's open source.

ND v2 also came with backwards compatibility for esx & qb which means if you have any esx or qb resources that you wish to install on your server, they will simply work as if they were running with their intended framework.
